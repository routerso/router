useFormState: ({ control: Control }) => FormState
-------------------------------------------------

```This custom hook allows you to subscribe to each form state, and isolate the re-render at the custom hook level. It has its scope in terms of form state subscription, so it would not affect other useFormState and useForm. Using this hook can reduce the re-render impact on large and complex form application.

Props
-----

The following table contains information about the arguments for `useFormState`.

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `control` | `object` | [`control`](https://react-hook-form.com/docs/useform/control) object provided by `useForm`. It's optional if you are using `FormProvider`. |
| `name` | `string | string[]` | Provide a single input name, an array of them, or subscribe to all inputs' formState update. |
| `disabled` | `boolean = false` | Option to disable the subscription.
 |
| `exact` | `boolean = false` | This prop will enable an exact match for input name subscriptions.

 |

Return
------

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `isDirty` | `boolean` | Set to `true` after the user modifies any of the inputs.
*   **Important:** Make sure to provide all inputs' defaultValues at the useForm, so hook form can have a single source of truth to compare whether the form is dirty.
    
    const {
    
    formState: { isDirty, dirtyFields },
    
    setValue,
    
    } \= useForm({ defaultValues: { test: "" } });
    
    setValue('test', 'change')
    
    setValue('test', '')
    
*   File typed input will need to be managed at the app level due to the ability to cancel file selection and [FileList](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileList) object.
    
*   Do not support custom object, Class or File object.
    

 |
| `dirtyFields` | `object` | An object with the user-modified fields. Make sure to provide all inputs' defaultValues via useForm, so the library can compare against the `defaultValues`.

*   **Important:** Make sure to provide defaultValues at the useForm, so hook form can have a single source of truth to compare each field's dirtiness.
    
*   Dirty fields will **not** represent as `isDirty` formState, because dirty fields are marked field dirty at field level rather the entire form. If you want to determine the entire form state use `isDirty` instead.
    

 |
| `touchedFields` | `object` | An object containing all the inputs the user has interacted with. |
| `defaultValues` | `object` | The value which has been set at [useForm](https://react-hook-form.com/docs/useform)'s defaultValues or updated defaultValues via [reset](https://react-hook-form.com/docs/useform/reset) API.

 |
| `isSubmitted` | `boolean` | Set to `true` after the form is submitted. Will remain `true` until the `reset` method is invoked. |
| `isSubmitSuccessful` | `boolean` | Indicate the form was successfully submitted without any runtime error.

 |
| `isSubmitting` | `boolean` | `true` if the form is currently being submitted. `false` otherwise. |
| `isLoading` | `boolean` | `true` if the form is currently loading async default values.

**Important:** this prop is only applicable to async `defaultValues`

const {

formState: { isLoading }

} \= useForm({

defaultValues: async () \=> await fetch('/api')

});





 |
| `submitCount` | `number` | Number of times the form was submitted. |
| `isValid` | `boolean` | Set to `true` if the form doesn't have any errors.

`setError` has no effect on `isValid` formState, `isValid` will always derived via the entire form validation result.

 |
| `isValidating` | `boolean` | Set to `true` during validation. |
| `validatingFields` | `boolean` | Capture fields which are getting async validation. |
| `errors` | `object` | An object with field errors. There is also an [ErrorMessage](https://react-hook-form.com/docs/useformstate/errormessage) component to retrieve error message easily. |

Rules
-----

Returned `formState` is wrapped with Proxy to improve render performance and skip extra computation if specific state is not subscribed, so make sure you deconstruct or read it before render in order to enable the subscription.

const { isDirty } \= useFormState();

const formState \= useFormState();

Examples
--------

import \* as React from "react";

import { useForm, useFormState } from "react-hook-form";

function Child({ control }) {

const { dirtyFields } \= useFormState({

control

});

return dirtyFields.firstName ? <p\>Field is dirty.</p\> : null;

};

export default function App() {

const { register, handleSubmit, control } \= useForm({

defaultValues: {

firstName: "firstName"

}

});

const onSubmit \= (data) \=> console.log(data);

return (

<form onSubmit\={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}\>

<input {...register("firstName")} placeholder\="First Name" /\>

<Child control\={control} /\>

<input type\="submit" /\>

</form\>

);

}
